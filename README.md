# Engineer Code Challenge (Vending Machine).
A vending machine which vends products based upon four (4) denominations of coins (50 Cent, 1 Rand, 2 Rand and 5 Rand), and returns coins if there is no item.

## Dependencies
[NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/en/) - A JavaScript runtime environment\
[Express](https://expressjs.com/) - A NodeJs framework\
[React](https://reactjs.org/) - A Front-end library\
[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - An open-source language which builds on JavaScript

## Setup and run
to setup this project, run the following commands on your terminal
```bash
1. to clone the project `git clone https://github.com/giftmbanda/vending_machine`
2. navigate to the project directory `cd vending_machine`
3. navigate to the back-end directory `cd back-end`
4. install necessary packages, modules `npm install`
5. to run the project run `npm start`
6. using POSTMAN you can use this default url of `http://localhost:4000`
```
we need to run our front-end too, by following similar steps!

```bash
7. from project directory, navigate to back-end with`cd front-end`
8. then install necessary packages, modules `npm install`
9. to run the project run `npm start`
10. this should start running the up on `http://localhost:3000`
```
I recommend that you use [POSTMAN](https://www.postman.com/) for testing this bank-end api or you can hook it up to your front-end application like [React](https://reactjs.org/).
